# Technology used for HotelDeals project:

* Java8 as a programming language
* Spring Boot-2.0.4 as a backend
* Thymeleaf-3.0.9, bootstrap-4.1.3, JQuery 3.3.1 as a frontend
* Junit 4 and Mockito
* Docker container to run the application
* Heroku
* Travis CI

## What i learn

bootstrap and thymeleaf and also how to connect to JSON API by using spring boot and the most important thing how to deploy the application to Heroku and also build the jar automatically by Travis CI after each push to the github.


## What i want to accomplish for this project:

* I test the backend service by using unit and mockito only, I want to ensure the behavior of the frontend by simulating the actual
  end user interacting with the pages in the web browser (clicking buttons and links,filling in and submitting forms, and so on). 
  For that reason, I want to write acceptance tests using selenium.


* Deployed the project to heroku by using the travis CI, as of now the build created automatically to the GitHub by travis CI.
